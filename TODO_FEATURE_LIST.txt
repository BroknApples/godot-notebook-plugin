1.
TabIn/TabOut buttons changing the parent of the current node rather than just visually tabbing

2.
Text formatting like bold, italic, heading type, font size -- when implemented will have to encode documents
in a special format (prob choose .gdnote extension) that will hold text_size and stuff kinda like
\font_size-16{data here}, MUST add export to txt button along with this

3.
Overall more side buttons(most will be text formatting buttons from number 2)
